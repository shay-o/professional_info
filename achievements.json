      "title": "Edge Enrichment at Massive Scale",
      "timeframe": "2021 - 2023",
      "context": "Adobe was modernizing its data collection infrastructure through Experience Edge. Multiple Adobe products (CJA, Adobe Analytics, AEP) needed enrichment services for incoming data, but each team was building their own solutions, leading to duplicated effort and inconsistent results.",
      "problem": "We needed centralized, high-performance enrichment services (geo lookup, bot detection, device lookup) that could handle tens of billions of requests per day with single-digit millisecond latency while maintaining SLAs for downstream systems. The challenge was building shared infrastructure that would work across multiple Adobe products with different requirements.",
      "actions": [
        "Led the initiative to design and build three enrichment services on Adobe Experience Edge",
        "Evaluated third-party vendors to determine the best functionality and cost trade-offs",
        "Drove cross-functional alignment across multiple Adobe businesses (CJA, AA, AEP) and technical teams",
        "Defined feature set and SLA requirements that balanced competing priorities",
        "Navigated complex shared infrastructure discussions, persuading teams to adopt approaches that would impact their users"
      ],
      "impact": {
        "quantitative": [
          "Achieved single-digit millisecond latency",
          "Handled tens of billions of lookups per day"

        "qualitative": [
          "Multiple Adobe businesses successfully consuming the service",
          "Eliminated duplicated vendor relationships",
          "Reduced overall costs",
