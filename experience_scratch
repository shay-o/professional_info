##Areas for improvement
- Storytelling. A vision to help people understand and get on board.
- Tracking towards something significant, as opposed to just a bunch of stuff
- Constant challenge to find time to be with customers (non-reactively), use the product vs deal with daily barrage of requests.
- Related. Time spent dealing with concerns and questions. This needs to be scaleable and not a large part of time. understanding the problems and the extent of their impact is important but cannot be consumed with customer issues.


## Projects and acheivements
### Adobe Analtytics (Sept 2020 - Sept 2025)
  - Client hints: Description tbd
  - Geo/Bot/Dev: Descritption tbd
  - Edge support
    - Pageview inflation
    - XDM Translator: Map legacy schema to new
    - General strategy around CJA migration. How to balance quick+dirty vs slow+clean. Had to balance across groups. Used shared infrastructure and needed to persuade that team to adopt our approach when it would impact other users of that infra.
    -  Many TTV projects. How to get customers onto CJA.
      - Projects around shim
      - Looked into how to use AI for this. Determine JTBD. Talk to customers about their specific problems. Understand the user base. The complex eco system of people at these companies
  - Omnivore: Map biz rules to XDM. Ease TTV. Lower effort and technical expertise and time needed to get setup on CJA
    - Applied to several use cases. 1) New AEM customers wanting quick AA implementation 2) New CJA customers 3) Existing CJA customers 4) Content Analytics
    - ACA onboarding workglow
    - AEM onboarding flow
  - Consent Navigator
  - IPv6: A project we decided NOT to move forward with. Embarassing and worth doing but not urgent. Some customers were affected strongly but had work arounds. Determined they weren't going to cancel b/c of this. 
  - Heatmap reporting (Activity Map): Proj
  - Learning: Working with highly technical engineering team and a manager who prefers to keep their roadmap opaque. Established a relationship and trust while also consistently pushing on process (what are we building? why? what if we don't? explain the resourcing. how are we tracking on these weekly through the quarter?

#### Other Adobe acheivements
- Established expertise in complex domain of data collection across legacy and Edge tools
- Strong cross-team experience on projects co-developed with AEP, AEM and IS
- Expertise and thought leadership on topics like “cookieless” and privacy in general including two Summit presentations
- Represented CJA in CEC and other meetings with senior customer leaders (MLB, Telstra, Casio, Bajaj). Was also slated to represent at Insider Tour LA before it was cancelled.

  

### At Adobe Ad Cloud (Dec 2017 - Sept 2020)
- AA4 AdC. Sooo much.
(Internal note: Focused a lot on troubleshooting and reacting to customers. Not building.) 
(Internal note: Reactive, not assertive. Push really hard with a  vision - this will likely just be regular pushing given my tendency to take direction instead of give it.)
- Rework the reporting UI. Done with Vic. Didn't get far.
- The expert in our attribution reporting system
- Portfolio was wide ranging. Owned reports, home, PINT/BI (internal reporting platform, also bespoke customer projects)
- Measurement team (Tom Riordan, etc). Support their consulting needs. Survey measurement tool.
- MMP support: Worked to integrate with Mobile Measurement Partners to allow data to flow to (ad impressions recorded by Ad Cloud) and from (conversions recorded by Adobe). 
- Update to frequency reporting. needed to overhaul our frequency reporting which was broken and very limited. Provided more detail. Also worked trhough some important technical questions. 
How do customers want their data (summary? distribution of frequencies? for what purpose?). Also how to communicate that the data was estimated 
- Owned Custom Reports (ie just reporting). Updated UI. [details?]
- Converstion Tracking was just complex.

### Narrative summary
When I arrived in the Analytics groupd I was starting from zero. I established strong expertise and command of a complex domain and used this to cover business-essential pathways like Edge collection for Analytics and CJA.	
Also guided important projects like Omnivore and Condor (aka Content Analytics) from early stages to execution. This involves in bridging executive vision, high-level business goals and complex user and customer sets. I work across different organizations (AEM,AEP) while also understanding different customer perspectives.
Strong cross-team experience working across AEP Edge teams (Edge Collection) as well as AEM and Intelligence Services (Omnivore, Condor)
Expertise and thought leadership on important collection topics like cookieless and privacy in general. This includes two summit presentations as well as many customer facing documents.
Beyond Summit presentations, took an expanded role in the PM team by representing CJA in customer meetings with MLB, Telstra and Casio. Signed up to do LA Insider Tour but it was cancelled.

## Themes

### Discovery

#### Market Research
#### Collaboration strategic thinking: Aligning with Travis and AJO team on Quick Start. Deciding how similar projects should proceed (join, in parallel? How to stay in touch? How think about long term (likely alignment) vs short-term independent pursuit of different work flows. Same for Condor and AEM+Omnivore
