# Experience with feedback and surveys. 

In my role as product manager my decisions were primarily driven by user/customer feedback. This feedback often came in the form of surveys and customer interviews. Examples of this work:

## Surveys

For one project we ran surveys through a third party. We defined the segments and audience we wanted to reach as well as the questions we wanted to answer. Some things we planned to learn: discover customer willingness to pay, relative importance of certain features, how these varied across different segments of customer (geo, vertical, size). 
We did surveys directly with customers. We chose a subset of existing customers and contacts and asked them similar questions
Customer Interviews: group 
We had several CAB (Customer Advisory Board) sessions. Had 1-1.5 hr sessions with multiple customers (4-7) on the call. These were recruited specifically based on their role. Some sessions covered a single topic others were covering multiple topics. In some cases I prepared material that was delivered by others who moderated the session. In others I lead the discussion.
For these CAB sessions we had a limited time with these important stakeholders. We had to be careful to structure the presentation to clearly gather the information. This included balancing between getting answers to specific questions as well as allowing for open ended feedback. 
Usually these were online/virtual but sometimes in person, say at a conference.

## Customer Interviews: 1 to 1

Spoke with customers regularly. Dozens of customer meetings.

## Customer relationships

Met regularly with customers to learn about their business. Discussed product features. Goal was to provide value and build good will and relationship so that we could understand what they 
	
## Dynamics

Had to structure to allow audience to clearly understand the topic and to elicit their opinion. Sometimes about sensitive topics like willingness to pay (e.g. value). 
	
Had to gather the right information to allow a) larger org and leadership to make a decision on whether to proceed and how. b) Understand what the ‘product’ should look like. We had to understand leadership perspective and what data points would be relevant for making a business case and for shaping what is required in the product (which has implications for technical implementation).

# Community engagement experience

Volunteered with EMS 6. This involved learning about how this organization worked including the larger system of city services. As a  team we interviewed everyone (EMS captains, management chain up 3 levels, various constituents across the city who provided information or provided services which clients were directed to. Besides surveys we each did three full days “ride along” sessions to see the work done by them. 
We synthesised this information and came up with findings nad recommendations which  we presented this report to city leadership. [find actual report?]
As PM had to  cultivate relationships with customers to understand how they work and what they need. This would include regular sessions helping them understand current topics. Helping them deal with specific problems they were having. This took the form of video conferences and in-person visits


# Technical tools R/SQL: Reporting tools

Work on internal reporting platform. Use R scripts and to automate production of customer-facing analyses and prediction modelling [name some models]. The pulled data using SQL.
Also have done a lot of custom analysis
Custom reporting and reporting/modelling for customers using R and SQL 
Manual analysis using Excel nad internal modelling tools
At Cardlytics was responsible for the reporting practice. Had to measure effectiveness of new advertising. This was a new product so required technical analysis.

# Collaboration and management

Managed a team of data scientists who did data analysis nad prediction for customers.
Oversaw development of a platform which automated these analyses
PM role is highly collaborative. Have to have a very close understanding of your customers perspective and experience. This is B2B so we need to understand the organization [examples?] as well. So our customer and their stakeholders (management, report consumers, technical teams).
Have to discuss projects before, during and after implementation with leadership. Advocating for why a  project should or shouldn’t proceed. For big/important projects we could report up several levels to VP (owner of ~4B in business)
Additionally there is a lot of collaboration needed to execute a project. Typically they involve many engineering teams who have their own priorities.
Consider myself an excellent technical communicator. I have experience doing this for EF/Adobe (presenting to customers technical modelling information. This was both presales and as current customer. Often presented to C-level. Also presented a conferences on technical topics). As a PM I built data products and presented on how they work, it is a relatively technical space that involved talking to all kinds of people.
